Before the program is run, a .jar file for the JSON libraries needs to be downloaded so that the Yale API can be accessed. The .jar file is downloadable here:
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20160810

To run (MajorReqs.java is the main file to run):
Enter in the major desired (economics, global affairs) after the program asks “What are you majoring in?”
Enter in the major code (econ, glbl) after the program asks "What is the major code?"
Run in Eclipse
Click on courses taken
Click next, and a new window will pop up with information regarding the courses a user still needs to take and can take the upcoming semester

Note: We have noticed that the Yale API system crashes at times and the URL returns an error. In this case, our program will not run, as it needs to retrieve information from the API. Usually, after waiting a couple of minutes, the program will work as expected, although this is completely dependent on Yale’s system.
